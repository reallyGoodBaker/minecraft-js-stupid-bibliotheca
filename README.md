# minecraft-js-stupid-bibliotheca
This is a library wrapper of [the interfaces related to gametest](https://docs.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/mojang-minecraft/mojang-minecraft)

# What we want to do
We want to make the interfaces are not as terrible as the mojang api

# What we want to say
mjsb forever

## File dirs
```
src
-- [Code is here]
dist
-- [Packaged code is here]
packager
-- [a tool can package code from folders]
```
## Plan
We will use init functions to get objects to change code easily(because mojang's api often chnages,too)
We wiil add the support of formatters, minecraft icon symbols, rawjson, and so on at soon.
We may add some ui support if mojang add ui support but it's stiil terrible
We want to make users import modules easily.

Good luck, This is the end
